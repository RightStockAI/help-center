# Understanding Confidence Levels

AI confidence levels indicate how certain the model is about its predictions. Learn how to interpret and use these scores effectively.

## Confidence Scale

### High Confidence (80-100%)
- **Very Strong Signals** - Multiple confirming factors
- **Clear Market Direction** - Strong trend or pattern
- **High Probability** - 75-85% chance of success
- **Actionable** - Suitable for portfolio decisions

### Moderate Confidence (60-79%)
- **Reasonable Signals** - Some supporting evidence
- **Mixed Factors** - Both positive and negative indicators
- **Medium Probability** - 60-70% chance of success
- **Cautious Action** - Consider smaller positions

### Low Confidence (30-59%)
- **Weak Signals** - Limited supporting evidence
- **Conflicting Factors** - Mixed or unclear indicators
- **Lower Probability** - 45-55% chance of success
- **Limited Action** - Monitor or avoid

### Very Low Confidence (0-29%)
- **Minimal Signals** - Very weak or contradictory evidence
- **High Uncertainty** - Unclear market direction
- **Low Probability** - &lt;40% chance of success
- **No Action** - Wait for clearer signals

## Factors Affecting Confidence

### Market Conditions
- **Trending Markets** - Higher confidence in clear trends
- **Ranging Markets** - Lower confidence in sideways action
- **High Volatility** - Reduced confidence in chaotic conditions
- **Low Volume** - Lower confidence in illiquid stocks

### Data Quality
- **Complete Data** - Higher confidence with comprehensive data
- **Recent Data** - More confidence in current information
- **Consistent Data** - Higher confidence in stable patterns
- **Outlier Events** - Lower confidence after major events

### Model Agreement
- **Consensus Models** - Higher confidence when models agree
- **Divergent Models** - Lower confidence when models disagree
- **Strong Signals** - Higher confidence with extreme readings
- **Neutral Signals** - Lower confidence with middle readings

## Using Confidence Levels

### Position Sizing
- **High Confidence** - 2-5% of portfolio per position
- **Moderate Confidence** - 1-2% of portfolio per position
- **Low Confidence** - 0.5-1% of portfolio per position
- **Very Low Confidence** - Avoid or very small test positions

### Risk Management
- **Stop Losses** - Tighter stops for lower confidence
- **Position Limits** - Smaller positions for uncertain predictions
- **Diversification** - More diversification for low confidence
- **Time Limits** - Shorter holding periods for uncertain calls

### Decision Framework
1. **Check Confidence** - Is it above 70%?
2. **Verify Signals** - Do technicals confirm?
3. **Assess Risk** - Is risk-reward attractive?
4. **Make Decision** - Buy, hold, or wait

## Common Misinterpretations

### Overconfidence Bias
- **High Scores Guarantee Success** - No, they're probabilities
- **Ignoring Risk** - High confidence doesn't eliminate risk
- **Emotional Decisions** - Confidence doesn't replace analysis

### Underconfidence Issues
- **Ignoring Good Signals** - Low confidence doesn't mean wrong
- **Analysis Paralysis** - Waiting for perfect confidence
- **Missed Opportunities** - Too conservative interpretation

## Improving Confidence Interpretation

### Historical Analysis
- **Track Performance** - How did similar confidence levels perform?
- **Pattern Recognition** - Learn from past predictions
- **Adjustment Factors** - Personal experience adjustments
- **Calibration** - Align confidence with actual outcomes

### Contextual Factors
- **Market Environment** - Adjust for current conditions
- **Stock Characteristics** - Different for large vs small caps
- **Time Horizon** - Confidence varies by timeframe
- **Personal Experience** - Learn from your track record
